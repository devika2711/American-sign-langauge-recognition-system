# American-sign-langauge-recognition-system
Sign language serves as a visual-gestural mode of communication mainly employed by people who are deaf or hard of hearing. It is an expressive language which employs hand gestures and body movements. Deaf people use sign language to communicate with one another and with the general public, but the general public does not value sign language. Because not everyone knows and understands sign language, communication between a normal person and a deaf or dumb person can become difficult. To overcome this obstacle, a machine learning model can be built. A real time model can be trained to recognise different sign language gestures and translate them. Many people can benefit from this in communicating and conversing with deaf and dumb people. This system helps deaf people join in education, work, and social activities. It makes things fairer by creating better ways to communicate, improving education, job chances, and making sure everyone feels included. Especially in emergencies, when it's important to understand each other quickly, this technology becomes super important for keeping everyone safe and making sure they can communicate well. Overall, this sign language system is a really important tool for including everyone and making it easy for people to talk to each other and be part of a diverse community This system employs a combination of technologies such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow for recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures in real time. The main goal is to allow real-time communication for individuals using sign language by capturing their hand gestures through a camera and translating them into textual representations.

REQUIREMENTS:
The project requires installation of python and related relevant packages such as:
● Cv2 (OpenCV): used for webcam access, image processing and visualisations.
● Numpy: which is required for numerical computations and array operations.
● Mediapipe: for hand landmark detection
● Tensorflow (with Keras): for loading and running the pre-trained CNN model.
